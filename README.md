## Things to note
- When running on localhost vite uses ```.env.development``` to connect to your backend (which must be running, more info here ðŸ‘‰ [React E-Commerce-Backend](https://github.com/Mini-Sylar/react-e-commerce-backend)). Update it when needed
- In production mode, ```.env.production``` will be used instead.
