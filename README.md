**To see a stripped down version with no JWT see [NO JWT](https://github.com/Mini-Sylar/react-e-commerce/tree/main)**

## Things to note
- When running on localhost vite uses ```.env.development``` to connect to your backend (which must be running, more info here ðŸ‘‰ [React E-Commerce-Backend With JWT](https://github.com/Mini-Sylar/react-e-commerce/tree/main-jwt)) . Update it when needed
- In production mode, ```.env.production``` will be used instead.
